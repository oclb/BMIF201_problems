# BMIF201_problems

This repository contains in-class problem sets for the population genetics unit of BMIF201. Before each class, 
a Jupyter notebook will be added containing problems to be completed during the second half of class. 
There is also a partial implementation of the Wright-Fisher model, 
which you will complete as part of your first problem set.

# Installation
You will need to have `Python` installed on your machine.  

In a shell terminal, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/oclb/BMIF201_problems`, 
and open the repo directory. 
Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv bmif201`, 
and activate it using, e.g., `source bmif201/bin/activate`. 
(This command is platform specific: see https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work).
Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then,
launch today's problem set as a  Jupyter Notebook using e.g., `jupyter notebook 01_mutation_and_drift.ipynb`.

After lecture 1, you'll be able to download the problem set for each lecture by navigating to the repo directory
and running `git pull`.
